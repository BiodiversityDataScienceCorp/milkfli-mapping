## About the Showy Milkweed (*A. speciosa*)

### Species Taxonomy:
+ **Kingdom:** Plantae (Plants) 
+ **Division:** Anthophyta (Flowering plants)
+ **Class:** Dicotyledoneae (Dicots)
+ **Order:** Gentianales (Dogbane / Gentian)
+ **Family:** Asclepiadaceae (Milkweeds)
+ **Species:** *Asclepias speciosa* (Showy Milkweed) 

### Species Description 
“A stout, sparingly branched, pubescent perennial, 1 1/2-3 ft. tall, with large, oval, blue-green leaves and showy, spherical clusters of rose-colored flowers. Flowers occur at the top of the stem and on stalks from leaf axils. A grayish, velvety plant with erect leafy stems and with umbels of star-like pinkish flowers in upper axils and at top. Sap milky.” (wildflower.org) Milkweed can spread asexually through rhizomes or sexually with seeds. It does not spread aggressively. It is also drought tolerant once established. 

### Habitat Description
“Found in habitats ranging from sunny and dry to moist in savannas, prairies, roadsides, old fields, and meadows.” (wildflower.org) 

### Larval Host Information
**Larvae feeds on *A. speciosa*:**
+ Monarch butterflies (*Danaus plexippus*: Nymphalidae)
+ Queen butterflies
+ Dogbane Tiger Moths
+ Red-Belted Clearwing Moth

**Foragers of *A. speciosa*:**
Honeybees, bumblebees, and other bee species!
